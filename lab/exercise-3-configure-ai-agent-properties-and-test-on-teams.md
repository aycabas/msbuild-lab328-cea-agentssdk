# Lab BMA3 - Integrate Azure AI Foundry Agent with M365 Agents SDK

In this exercise, you’ll bring together the best of both worlds—combining the generative AI power of your Azure AI Foundry agent with the multi-channel flexibility of the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK. You’ll configure Semantic Kernel, set up agent properties, and securely connect to your Foundry-hosted agent to deliver rich, enterprise-aware answers directly in Microsoft Teams.

## Exercise 1: Configure agent properties and test on Teams

Now that you’ve created a basic bot, it’s time to enhance it with generative AI capabilities and upgrade it to an AI agent. In this exercise, you’ll install key libraries such as Semantic Kernel and prepare your agent to reason and respond more intelligently, ready for Teams or Copilot Chat.

### Step 1: Add Semantic Kernel Nuget Package

The package you'll add in this step will provide support for Azure AI integration. Right-click to **ContosoHRAgent** project and select **Manage Nuget Packages...**, select **Browse** tab and search for `Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Agents.AzureAI`. Make sure to check **Include prerelease** checkbox. Select the package and select **Install**.

![Semantic Kernel Nuget Package](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37a290f4-e825-4140-a294-b1a8d9e1f10a)

Select **Apply** and **I Accept** in the following pop-up boxes to carry on with installation.

### Step 2: Add Semantic Kernel in Program.cs

Open **Program.cs** and add the following code snippet right before var *app = builder.Build()*:

```
builder.Services.AddKernel();
```

This registers the Semantic Kernel, a core component that allows your agent to interact with generative AI models.

### Step 3: Add custom classes for document citations and message tracking

Right-click to **ContosoHRAgent** project and select **Add > Class** and define your class name as `FileReference.cs`. Replace the existing code with the following:

> This class defines the structure used when referencing specific documents in responses—useful when your agent cites content from uploaded files.

```
using Microsoft.Agents.Core.Models;
  
namespace ContosoHRAgent
{
    public class FileReference(string fileId, string fileName, string quote, Citation citation)
    {
        public string FileId { get; set; } = fileId;
        public string FileName { get; set; } = fileName;
        public string Quote { get; set; } = quote;
        public Citation Citation { get; set; } = citation;
    }
}
```

Right-click to **ContosoHRAgent** project and select **Add > Class** and define your class name as `ConversationStateExtensions.cs`. Replace existing the code with following:

> This class adds helper methods to manage and track the number of user messages—demonstrating how state is stored and modified during an ongoing conversation.

```
using Microsoft.Agents.Builder.State;
  
namespace ContosoHRAgent
{
 public static class ConversationStateExtensions
 {
     public static int MessageCount(this ConversationState state) => state.GetValue<int>("countKey");

     public static void MessageCount(this ConversationState state, int value) => state.SetValue("countKey", value);

     public static int IncrementMessageCount(this ConversationState state)
     {
         int count = state.GetValue<int>("countKey");
         state.SetValue("countKey", ++count);
         return count;
     }

     public static string ThreadId(this ConversationState state) => state.GetValue<string>("threadId");

     public static void ThreadId(this ConversationState state, string value) => state.SetValue("threadId", value);
 }
}
```

## Exercise 2: Integrate Azure AI Foundry Agent with M365 Agents SDK

You’ve built an agent using the M365 Agents SDK and configured it with generative AI capabilities. Now, you’ll connect this local agent to the Azure AI Foundry agent you created earlier. This enables your agent to respond using enterprise data and instructions stored in the Foundry project, bringing everything full circle.

### Step 1: Configure EchoBot.cs to Connect with Azure AI Foundry Agent

In this step, you’ll connect to the Azure AI Foundry agent by adding a client to fetch and invoke your Foundry-hosted model inside the EchoBot.cs.

In **ContosoHRAgent** project, open **Bot/EchoBot.cs** and add the following lines inside the EchoBot public class:

```
private readonly PersistentAgentsClient _projectClient;
private readonly string _agentId;
```

Replace the existing EchoBot constructor with the following: 

```
public EchoBot(AgentApplicationOptions options, IConfiguration configuration) : base(options)
{

    OnConversationUpdate(ConversationUpdateEvents.MembersAdded, WelcomeMessageAsync);

    // Listen for ANY message to be received. MUST BE AFTER ANY OTHER MESSAGE HANDLERS 
    OnActivity(ActivityTypes.Message, OnMessageAsync);

    // Azure AI Foundry Project ConnectionString
    string projectEndpoint = configuration["AIServices:ProjectEndpoint"];
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(projectEndpoint))
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("ProjectEndpoint is not configured.");
    }
    _projectClient = new PersistentAgentsClient(projectEndpoint, new AzureCliCredential());

    // Azure AI Foundry Agent Id
    _agentId = configuration["AIServices:AgentID"];
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(_agentId))
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("AgentID is not configured.");
    }

}
```

Replace **OnMessageAsync** method with the following:

```
protected async Task OnMessageAsync(ITurnContext turnContext, ITurnState turnState, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    // send the initial message to the user
    await turnContext.StreamingResponse.QueueInformativeUpdateAsync("Working on it...", cancellationToken);

    // get the agent definition from the project
    var agentDefinition = await _projectClient.Administration.GetAgentAsync(_agentId, cancellationToken);

    // initialize a new agent instance from the agent definition
    var agent = new AzureAIAgent(agentDefinition, _projectClient);

    // retrieve the threadId from the conversation state
    // this is set if the agent has been invoked before in the same conversation
    var threadId = turnState.Conversation.ThreadId();

    // if the threadId is not set, we create a new thread
    // otherwise, we use the existing thread
    var thread = string.IsNullOrEmpty(threadId)
        ? new AzureAIAgentThread(_projectClient)
        : new AzureAIAgentThread(_projectClient, threadId);

    try
    {
        // increment the message count in state and queue the count to the user
        int count = turnState.Conversation.IncrementMessageCount();
        turnContext.StreamingResponse.QueueTextChunk($"({count}) ");

        // create the user message to send to the agent
        var message = new ChatMessageContent(AuthorRole.User, turnContext.Activity.Text);

        // invoke the agent and stream the responses to the user
        await foreach (AgentResponseItem<StreamingChatMessageContent> agentResponse in agent.InvokeStreamingAsync(message, thread, cancellationToken: cancellationToken))
        {
            // if the threadId is not set, we set it from the agent response
            // and store it in the conversation state for future use
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(threadId))
            {
                threadId = agentResponse.Thread.Id;
                turnState.Conversation.ThreadId(threadId);
            }

            turnContext.StreamingResponse.QueueTextChunk(agentResponse.Message.Content);
        }
    }
    finally
    {
        // ensure we end the streaming response
        await turnContext.StreamingResponse.EndStreamAsync(cancellationToken);
    }
}

```

### Step 2: Configure Azure AI Agent Service Keys

Add your Foundry connection details to appsettings.json, these values connect your M365 agent to the correct Foundry project and agent. In **ContosoHRAgent** project, open **appsettings.json** and add the following lines at the bottom of the appsettings list:

```
,
  "AIServices": {
   "AgentID": "<AzureAIFoundryAgentId>",
   "ProjectEndpoint": "<ProjectEndpoint>"
  }
```

> You can find these values in the **Overview** and **Agents Playground** sections of Azure AI Foundry.

Replace the **<AzureAIFoundryAgentId>** with your **Agent id** which can be found in **Agents Playground**.

![The Agents Playground of Azure AI Foundry with the Agent id field highlighted.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13421287-d476-41c4-88df-bed1bff2f2f8)

Replace **<ProjectEndpoint>** with your AI Foundry project endpoing which can be found in the **Overview** page of the AI Foundry, under Endpoints and keys.

Final version of the **appsettings.json** will look like below:

```
{
  "AgentApplicationOptions": {
    "StartTypingTimer": false,
    "RemoveRecipientMention": false,
    "NormalizeMentions": false
  },
  
  "TokenValidation": {
    "Audiences": [
      "{{ClientId}}" // this is the Client ID used for the Azure Bot
    ]
  },
  
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Agents": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Connections": {
    "BotServiceConnection": {
      "Settings": {
        "AuthType": "UserManagedIdentity", // this is the AuthType for the connection, valid values can be found in Microsoft.Agents.Authentication.Msal.Model.AuthTypes.
        "ClientId": "{{BOT_ID}}", // this is the Client ID used for the connection.
        "TenantId": "{{BOT_TENANT_ID}}",
        "Scopes": [
          "https://api.botframework.com/.default"
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "ConnectionsMap": [
    {
      "ServiceUrl": "*",
      "Connection": "BotServiceConnection"
    }
  ],
  "AIServices": {
   "AgentID": "<AzureAIFoundryAgentId>",
   "ProjectEndpoint": "<ProjectEndpoint>"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Test your agent on Teams

Open **Tools > Command Line > Developer Command Prompt** and run:

```
az login
```

A window will pop up on your browser and you'll need to sign into your Microsoft account to successfully complete az login. Use the following credentials to **Sign in**:
  - **Email**: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++
  - **Password**: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password+++

Expand **Start** and select **Dev Tunnels > Create a Tunnel**:
 
* Select **Sign in** and **Work or school account**. Login with the same credentials mentioned above.
* Provide a name for your tunnel such as `DevTunnel`.
* Keep the Tunnel Type **Temporary**.
* Select Access as **Public** and then **Create**.

Right click to **M365Agent** project, select **Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit > Select Microsoft 365 Account**.

![The context menu of the the M365 Agents Toolkit when selecting the Microsoft 365 Account to use, highlighted in the screenshot.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6981343d-8668-4b33-b36f-63b12739fc9d)

Select the same account as before and select **Continue** to use it. If your account doesn't show up automatically, select **Sign in** and **Work or school account**.
  
Expand the startup item on top of Visual Studio, where there is by default **<Multiple Startup Projects>**, and Select **Microsoft Teams (browser)**.

![The UI of Visual Studio when configuring Microsoft Teams (browser) for testing the agent in debug mode.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f564f0a-0394-49de-a679-6be59761b4fb)

You're now ready to run your integrated agent and test it live in Microsoft Teams. Make sure your dev tunnel is created and your account is authenticated.

Once Dev Tunnel is created, hit **Start** or **F5** to start debugging. Microsoft Teams will launch automatically, and your agent app will pop up on the window. Select **Add** and **Open** to start chatting with your agent.  

>**⚠️ Note:** If the agent doesn't show up automatically on Microsoft Teams (Browser), select **Apps > Manage your apps > Upload an app** and then select **Upload a custom app** on Teams. In the File Explorer go to your project folder +++C:\Users\LabUser\source\repos\ContosoHRAgent\M365Agent\appPackage\build+++ select **appPackage.local.zip**, then select **Add** and **Open**.
>![The UI of Microsoft Teams when uploading an app, with the "Upload an app" command highlighted.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fad723f-b087-4481-8c8c-d5ad87c1bead)

You can ask one of the following questions to interact with the agent:

- +++What’s the difference between Northwind Standard and Health Plus when it comes to emergency and mental health coverage?+++
- +++Can I use PerksPlus to pay for both a rock climbing class and a virtual fitness program?+++
- +++What values guide behavior and decision-making at Contoso Electronics?+++

You should observe that you are getting similar responses with the agent you've created on Azure AI Foundry.
