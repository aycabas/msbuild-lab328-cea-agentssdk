# Wrap-Up

Congratulations! You've completed the lab and built your first Custom Engine Agent with the M365 Agents SDK and Azure AI Foundry!

In this lab, you learned how to:

- Create and configure an AI agent in Azure AI Foundry using the Agent Playground.
- Upload documents to ground your agent with enterprise knowledge.
- Scaffold a basic bot project with the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK in Visual Studio.
- Enhance your bot with Semantic Kernel and integrate Azure AI Agent Service.
- Connect your local agent to the Foundry agent for real-time, grounded responses.
- Test your agent in **Teams** and **Copilot Chat** as a custom engine agent.

## Next Steps

- Customize your agent's personality and instructions.
- Try different domains, documents, or multi-agent patterns.
