> As you follow the instructions in this pane, whenever you see a +++icon+++, you can use it to copy text from the instruction pane into the virtual machine interface. This is particularly useful to copy code; but bear in mind you may need to modify the pasted code to fix indent levels or formatting before running it!

## Exercises in this lab

Now you're ready to complete the exercises in this lab. The lab includes multiple exercises, so when you finish one, just move onto the next one. The exercises in this lab are:

- Prepare your agent in Azure AI Foundry
- Build your first agent using M365 Agents SDK
- Integrate Azure AI Foundry agent with M365 Agents SDK
- Bring your agent to Copilot Chat

The exercises are designed to be completed in order because they build on the data and resources created in the previous exercises, so make sure you complete each exercise before moving on to the next one.

Don't worry if you run out of time to complete the entire lab. All of these exercises (and more) are available on [Copilot Developer Camp](https://aka.ms/copilotdevcamp).
